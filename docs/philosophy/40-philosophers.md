# A Quick Introduction to 40+ Philosophers

*reference: A Little History of Philosophy*

Socrates: The only thing I know is that I know nothing.

Plato: If you want to understand something, you need to concentrate on the *Form* of it.

Aristotle: The way to understand any general category was to examine particular examples of it. To seek the true happiness, one should develop the right kind of character, become better people, and do the right thing.

Pyrrho: Everything can be questioned, everything doubted, never trust our senses.

Epicurus: The best way to live is have a very simple lifestyle, be kind to those around you, and surround yourself with friends.

Epictetus: Our thoughts are up to us.

Cicero: We should both accept the natural process of aging and recoginize that the attitude we take to that process need not to be pessimistic.

Seneca: We should not feel angry that life is short, but instead should make the most use of it.

Augustine: God has given us free will. But a consequence of having free will is that we can decide to do evil.

Boethius: The reason why God can know the future without destroying our free will and turning us into some kind of preprogrammed machines with no choice at all is that God observes us at no particular time at all. What this means is that God grasps everything in an instant. God sees past, present and future as one.

Anselm: As a matter of logic, the fact that we have an idea of God proves that God actually exists. It was logically impossible to have an idea of God without God actually existing.

Aquinas: Each thing that exists has a cause of some kind that brought it into being and made it as it is. Logically there must at some point have been something that set everything going in this chain of causes and effects. This first cause must have been God. God is the uncaused cause of everything that is.

Niccolò Machiavelli: An effective prince has to ‘learn how not to be good; result was more important than how it was achieved; it’s better as a leader to be feared than to be loved.

Thomas Hobbes: The individuals in the state of nature would have to enter into a ‘social contract’, an agreement to give up some of their dangerous freedoms for the sake of safety. All aspects of human existence, including thinking, were physical activities.

René Descartes: *(Method of Cartesian Doubt)* Don’t accept anything as true if there is the slightest possibility that it isn’t. Something that doesn’t exist can’t have thoughts. ‘I think, therefore I am’ *(cogito ergo sum in Latin)*. I’m thinking, so I must exist. As soon as you start to doubt your own existence, the act of doubting proves that you exist as a thinking thing. *(Cartesian Dualism)* It is a dualism because there are two types of thing: the mind and the body.

Blaise Pascal: *(Pascal’s Wager)* You can choose to live your life as if God does exist. If you win you win everything; if you lose you lose nothing.
