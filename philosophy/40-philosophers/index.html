<blockquote>
<p><em>reference: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11527504-a-little-history-of-philosophy">A Little History of Philosophy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Socrates: The only thing I know is that I know nothing.</p>
<p>Plato: If you want to understand something, you need to concentrate on the <em>Form</em> of it.</p>
<p>Aristotle: The way to understand any general category was to examine particular examples of it. To seek the true happiness, one should develop the right kind of character, become better people, and do the right thing.</p>
<p>Pyrrho: Everything can be questioned, everything doubted, never trust our senses.</p>
<p>Epicurus: The best way to live is have a very simple lifestyle, be kind to those around you, and surround yourself with friends.</p>
<p>Epictetus: Our thoughts are up to us.</p>
<p>Cicero: We should both accept the natural process of aging and recoginize that the attitude we take to that process need not to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Seneca: We should not feel angry that life is short, but instead should make the most use of it.</p>
<p>Augustine: God has given us free will. But a consequence of having free will is that we can decide to do evil.</p>
<p>Boethius: The reason why God can know the future without destroying our free will and turning us into some kind of preprogrammed machines with no choice at all is that God observes us at no particular time at all. What this means is that God grasps everything in an instant. God sees past, present and future as one.</p>
<p>Anselm: As a matter of logic, the fact that we have an idea of God proves that God actually exists. It was logically impossible to have an idea of God without God actually existing.</p>
<p>Aquinas: Each thing that exists has a cause of some kind that brought it into being and made it as it is. Logically there must at some point have been something that set everything going in this chain of causes and effects. This first cause must have been God. God is the uncaused cause of everything that is.</p>
<p>Niccolò Machiavelli: An effective prince has to ‘learn how not to be good; result was more important than how it was achieved; it’s better as a leader to be feared than to be loved.</p>
<p>Thomas Hobbes: The individuals in the state of nature would have to enter into a ‘social contract’, an agreement to give up some of their dangerous freedoms for the sake of safety. All aspects of human existence, including thinking, were physical activities.</p>
<p>René Descartes: <em>(Method of Cartesian Doubt)</em> Don’t accept anything as true if there is the slightest possibility that it isn’t. Something that doesn’t exist can’t have thoughts. ‘I think, therefore I am’ <em>(cogito ergo sum in Latin)</em>. I’m thinking, so I must exist. As soon as you start to doubt your own existence, the act of doubting proves that you exist as a thinking thing. <em>(Cartesian Dualism)</em> It is a dualism because there are two types of thing: the mind and the body.</p>
<p>Blaise Pascal: <em>(Pascal’s Wager)</em> You can choose to live your life as if God does exist. If you win you win everything; if you lose you lose nothing. </p>
<p>Baruch Spinoza: Even though our own choices can never be fully free, it is better to be active than passive.</p>
<p>Jone Locke: I could be the same 'man', but not the same 'person' I was previously. What matters in questions about personal identity is psychological continuity. Your personal identity only extends as far back as your memory.</p>
<p>George Berkeley: Anything that stops being observed ceases to exist. The world and everything in it only exist in people's mind.</p>
<p>Gottfried Leibniz: God must have made the best of all possible worlds, the one with the least amount of evil needed to achieve that result.</p>
<p>Voltaire: The only way to make life bearable is to stop philosophizing and get down to work, 'we must cultivate our garden'. Cultivating our garden is a metaphor for doing something useful for humanity rather than just talking about abstract philosophical questions.</p>
<p>David Hume: Just because it looks designed, it doesn't follow that it really was designed; nor does it follow that God was the designer.</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau: 'Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains'. Only when we follow the General Will are we truly free. If someone failed to recognize that obeying a law was in the interest of the community, then that person should be 'forced to be free'.</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant(1): A priori synthetic knowledge, knowledge that reveals truth about the world, yet is arrived at independently of experience, is possible. We could make discoveries about reality that had to be true, yet weren't just true by definition: they could be informative.</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant(2): Sympathy is irrelevant to the morality of action. Morality wasn't just about what you do, but about why you do it. Those who do the right thing don't do it simply because of how they feel: the decision has to be based on reason, reason that tells you what your duty is, regardless of how you happen to feel. Having good intentions isn't enough to make your action moral. Kant made morality available to every rational person, whether or not they were fortunate enough to have feelings that motivated them to act well.</p>
<p>Jeremy Bentham: The right thing to do is whatever will produce the most happiness. How the pleasure is produced doesn't matter at all. Pleasure could be quantified and different pleasures compared on the same scale, in the same units.</p>
<p>Georg W.F. Hegel: 'The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk.' Wisdom and understanding in the course of human history will only come fully at late stage, when we're looking back on what has already happened. History has an end target, it's the gradual and inevitable coming to self-awareness of Spirit through the march of reason. We can move closer to truth by following his dialectical method. Spirit became aware of its own freedom and society was as a result ordered by principles of reason.</p>
<p>Arthur Schopenhauer: Reality has two aspects. It exists both as Will and as Representation. We can glimpse World as Will through our own actions and also through our experience of art. Art provides a still point so that, for a short time, we can escape the endless cycle of striving and desire.</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill: Greater happiness would come from individuals having greater freedom in how they behaved. You know much better than they do what you really want to do with your life. And even if you don't, it is better to let each of us make our own mistakes than to force us conform with one way of living. Offence should not be confused with harm.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin: Species evolved through a natural selection process, the process that leads the best-adapted to survive to pass on their characteristics.</p>
<p>William James: Truth is what works.</p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche: The death of God opened up new possibilities for humanity. Values such as compassion, kindness, and consideration of other people's interests, could all be challenged.</p>
<p>Sigmund Freud: There are things that we want to do that we don’t realize we want to do. These unconscious desires have a deep influence on all our lives and on the way we organize society. The mind represses them, keeps them down in the unconscious. Dreams were "the royal road to the unconscious", one of the best ways of finding out about hidden thoughts.</p>
<p>Bertrand Russell: </p>
